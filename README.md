# SideStarter

**SideStarter** is a community-first web and mobile app that helps underserved individuals — especially youth and first-time earners — find small, local gig opportunities and build their first income stream.

Designed to be simple, motivational, and accessible (even offline), SideStarter empowers users with the tools, knowledge, and confidence to take that first step toward financial independence.
